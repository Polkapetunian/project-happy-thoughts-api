# Project Happy Thoughts API

This is the backend of an app called Happy thoughts. The app allows you to post a thought and like the existing thoughts. I have built the frontend in an earlier project. The purpose of this project was to practise setting up an API that allows users to POST data to a database in MongoDB. It is built using Node.js with Express and MongoDB with Mongoose.

## The problem

I used Mongoose methods from the lectures.

## View it live

Every project should be deployed somewhere. Be sure to include the link to the deployed project so that the viewer can click around and see what it's all about.
